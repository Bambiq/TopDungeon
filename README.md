A project created in a group of three people for a Unity course during the second year of studies. We developed a dungeon crawler game in Unity using C#, leveraging pre-made assets and implementing mechanics inspired by dungon crawling games. The game features experience points, leveling, enemies, and bosses. It starts in a lobby where players can select a character and purchase weapons. From there, players are transported to a random dungeon, which can only be exited after defeating the boss. The dungeons contain scattered enemies, treasure chests filled with gold, and healing fountains.
