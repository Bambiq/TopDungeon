# 🗡️ Top Dungeon

A **dungeon crawler**, a game developed by me and two other students during our second year of our studies for a Unity course. Built in **Unity** using **C#**, the game takes it's inspiration from the **dungeon crawlers games**, featuring character progression, enemy encounters, and random dungeons.
